This is a machine learning project where we detect breast cancer using a dataset from Kaggle. We trained the dataset using various machine learning algorithims like KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The major goal is to use AI technologies to successfully
address medical concerns. Our investigation involves multiple
steps including data cleaning, preprocessing, encoding and
model evaluation & comparison. The dataset is divided into a
70:30 train-test ratio to ensure accurate model evaluation
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are the four
machine learning (ML) models we use. These models are
trained and assessed using critical performance measures such
as precision, F1 score, recall, accuracy, and confusion matrix
analysis.
